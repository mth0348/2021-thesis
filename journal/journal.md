# Meeting protocol 

## \#01: February 22, 2021
### Formal and technical questions
* Repository? -> will be setup by tutor.
* Project specification? Should be analogous to project2 work. Topics should include:
    * What is the goal?
    * Was has been previously achieved?
* The expert's name is *Dr. Eric Dubuis* (not the same as the teacher)

### Meeting discussion
Gitlab repository [2021-BSc-weather-rendering-system](https://gitlab.ti.bfh.ch/cpvr-students/2021-bsc-weather-rendering-system) should be used as storage for all project files.

There should be two meetings with expert (may or may not include tutor):
* After the specification is written
    * Present what was achieved previously, present objective target
* At the end of the semester, before deadline is due.

**Documentation guidelines**
* Introductory chapter:
    * Results of previous work (include screenshots)
    * Sketch / estimate what is planned for thesis
* Lay out specific requirements, like UI params for weather system
* Meeting schedule (every Thursday, 2pm, starting 04.03.2021)
* Document to be finished by 19.03.2021 (draft to be submitted by 15.03.2021)

**Possible Topics**
* Performance optimization (compute shaders)
* Different layers of clouds (restrictive, only focus on important categories)
* Parameter-based system, render weather based on preset of data, interpolate between presets
* Realtime comparison
* Interview with meteoblue
    * If so, only do one
    * be serious, be informed
    * NEBIS school books as alternative literature (library in Biel)
* Check personal contacts, maybe someone knows about accurate realtime weather data
* Comaprison between real and rendered image would go beyond of scope
* MS Flight Simulator as source for comparison

**Tasks**
* Setup specification document
    * Lay out all topics, sum up, categorize, prioritize
    * Focus only on what makes sense for thesis
* Check out NVIDIA NSight debugger
* Setup meeting with meteoblue - How to extract cloud genera


Next meeting is scheduled for **March 4th, 2021 at 2pm.**

## \#02: March 04, 2021
### Formal and technical questions
* How do I quote my own work?
* Should I explain things that are already explained in project2?
* MS Flight Simulator license? Gifting or paying in advance?
* Cite Udemy course?
* meteoblue interview idea:
    * (before interview: decide on types of clouds)
    * ask about most important types of clouds
    * talk about API and how data is processed for API
    * ask about how each property would influence cloud image
    * ask about "pictocode" property
