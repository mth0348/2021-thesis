# Meeting protocol 

## \#01: February 22, 2021
### Formal and technical questions
* Repository? -> will be setup by tutor.
* Project specification? Should be analogous to project2 work. Topics should include:
    * What is the goal?
    * Was has been previously achieved?
* The expert's name is *Dr. Eric Dubuis* (not the same as the teacher)

### Meeting discussion
Gitlab repository [2021-BSc-weather-rendering-system](https://gitlab.ti.bfh.ch/cpvr-students/2021-bsc-weather-rendering-system) should be used as storage for all project files.

There should be two meetings with expert (may or may not include tutor):
* After the specification is written
    * Present what was achieved previously, present objective target
* At the end of the semester, before deadline is due.

**Documentation guidelines**
* Introductory chapter:
    * Results of previous work (include screenshots)
    * Sketch / estimate what is planned for thesis
* Lay out specific requirements, like UI params for weather system
* Meeting schedule (every Thursday, 2pm, starting 04.03.2021)
* Document to be finished by 19.03.2021 (draft to be submitted by 15.03.2021)

**Possible Topics**
* Performance optimization (compute shaders)
* Different layers of clouds (restrictive, only focus on important categories)
* Parameter-based system, render weather based on preset of data, interpolate between presets
* Realtime comparison
* Interview with meteoblue
    * If so, only do one
    * be serious, be informed
    * NEBIS school books as alternative literature (library in Biel)
* Check personal contacts, maybe someone knows about accurate realtime weather data
* Comaprison between real and rendered image would go beyond of scope
* MS Flight Simulator as source for comparison

**Tasks**
* Setup specification document
    * Lay out all topics, sum up, categorize, prioritize
    * Focus only on what makes sense for thesis
* Check out NVIDIA NSight debugger
* Setup meeting with meteoblue - How to extract cloud genera


Next meeting is scheduled for **March 4th, 2021 at 2pm.**

## \#02: March 04, 2021
### Formal and technical questions
1. How do I quote my own work?
2. Should I explain things that are already explained in project2?
3. MS Flight Simulator license? Gifting or paying in advance?
4. Cite Udemy course?
5. meteoblue interview idea:
    * (before interview: decide on types of clouds)
    * ask about most important types of clouds
    * talk about API and how data is processed for API
    * ask about how each property would influence cloud image
    * ask about "pictocode" property

### Meeting discussion
Inputs from tutor:
* Swiss Landestopographie data has been released, Luftbilddaten, Höhenmodelldaten, Geländedaten
    * Could be used to generate mesh, from topo grid
    * Orthographic photos can be used as textures
* PCs from lab can be used if performance is needed
* "Previous work" chapter in RS in chapter 2
* chapter testing: detailed testing for new features: like UI
* expert meeting
    * introduction (general overview, why/what is shader, basics)
    * technical dive ok, but not too deep

* final results:
    * printed version, including CD with source,
    * due: at defense

**Answers to questions:**
1. a basic introduction to those topics is necessary, reference to project2 work, just mention previous work, citing is ok, reference is not necessary, but mention project2.
2. only if different, or based on previous work.
3. buy, spesen, herr gasenzer für spesen
4. cite udemy course, and section
5. bewölkungsgrad standard skala? 1/8 bewölkung
    * ask how pictocode is made
    * rainspot, what distance?
    * label as "technical meeting", not interview, but still call
