\section{Introduction}
Creating a weather rendering system is an fascinating, but intricate and challenging task.
It is important to first understand the basic nature of clouds. The first chapter will provide that information and describe the ten primary classifications of clouds.
\\
The next chapter describes a crucial part of the project and lays out a plan for an implementation approach. It further discusses possible technical solutions and presents an alternative approach, should the first fail.
\\
To approximate the chaotic behaviour of Nature, a clever way of creating a seemingly random pattern has to be found.
Chapter 5 explains and illustrates such an algorithm in great detail.
\\
With the gathered information and gained knowledge, the implementation can begin. Chapter 6 presents the achieved results in both a technical and visual way.
After that, the results are critically evaluated in the next chapter.
\\
Finally, the project management is summarized and the it is validated whether or not all of the specified requirements were met.
