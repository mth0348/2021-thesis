Viewed from a critical perspective, two out of three prototypes have been developed duringthe project, of which one was dropped because it was too similar to another.  Additionally,a complete cloud shader has been programmed, which was not originally planned.  However,it combined all research into one practical example of how to create such a cloud shader.Compared to state-of-the-art cloud shaders, the one made during this project can keep up interms of appearance and customization options, but lacks good performance and the abilityto render different cloud types.In section 4, sphere tracing is extensively described and explained in detail, but was not usedin the final prototype, as there is no defined SDF for a cloud volume.  The same applies forall shadow related algorithms.  The shader does not use shadow rays nor include ambientocclusion.44
