\section{Technical Implementation}
\label{section:techimpl}
This section describes the current solution, the implemented software architecture and the final results of the project.
Discrepancies between the planned implementation approach and the current solution are listed in \sectionref{section:techimpl:comparison_impl}.

\subsection{Meteoblue Integration}
\label{section:techimpl:meteoblue}
While the bachelor project specifictation document described the use of \emph{meteoblue}'s "basic 1h" package, this was not the only package that was used in the final implementation.
After the cancellation of the technical interview with \emph{meteoblue} and further research into additional, available weather data sources, the package "clouds 1h" was suggested.
It provides an overview of cloud coverage percentage for each cloud layer, which is exactly what the implementation was missing.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|l|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Package name}   & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
    Basic (1h)              & Mainly used for shading and visual effects. \\ \hline
    Clouds (1h)             & Mainly used for cloud coverage data. \\ \hline

The following table displays a list of properties from both data packages and how they are used in the final implementation.

    Cloud coverage high         & Clouds (1h)         & Used for the weather in Bern                   \\ \hline
    Total cloud coverage        & Clouds (1h)         & Used for the distant weather                   \\ \hline

Other properties like temperature and UV index provide insufficient or irrelevant information and have therefore not been mapped.

\subsection{ArcGIS Integration}
\label{section:techimpl:arcgis}
During the research phase of the project, the \emph{ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity} \cite{arcgis:unitysdk} was found. This proved to be a suitable replacement for the originally planned \emph{swisstopo} elevation model data.
The plugin was easily installed. The setup process required minimal amount of effort and the plugin was ready to run in no time. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\noindent
The plugin generates and renders map tiles according to the elevation model and automatically maps aerial photographs as textures on top.
This happens during runtime and is continuously updated.
\\
After setting up the plugin in Unity, the camera needed to be positioned on top of the Gurten mountain. Also, there needed to be a translation mechanic to move the camera to the top of the Bantiger mountain.
This was done with via script and is not part of the \emph{ArcGIS} plugin.

\subsection{Shader Architecture}

The architecture described in the implementation approach in \sectionref{section:impl:layers} was chosen, but underwent some alterations.

\subsection{Noise Generation}
\label{section:techimpl:noise}
As extensively described in \sectionref{section:noise}, the \gls{noise} texture is generated by a \gls{computeshader}.
The resulting 3D texture is seamless and is solely based on the Voronoi \gls{noisegeneration} algorithm, invoked with different scales and octaves.
In the final texture, each \gls{texel} holds four different \gls{noise} values, one for each color channel.
\\
The compute shader is dispatched only once, at the start of the simulation. This saves on a great deal of performance, as the \gls{noise} does not need to be recalculated each frame.

\subsection{Shadow Casting}
\label{section:techimpl:shadow}
The \gls{volumetric} cloud \gls{shader}s do not contain a \gls{shadowpass}, which means that the cloud objects do not cast any shadows.
The reason for this is that the \emph{ArcGIS} plugin generates and renders the
