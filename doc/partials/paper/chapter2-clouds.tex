\section{Natural Clouds}
Clouds are a substantial part of Earth's weather. They provide shade from the glistening sun on hot days and reflect the heat at night, keeping the ground warmer.
For a layman, clouds are comprehensible and useful indicators for telling the weather. If they are dark and low-hanging, they bring rain. If they are puffy and scarce, they predict fair weather ahead.

\subsection{Types of Clouds}
In order to create a \gls{wrs} that is able to display many different cloudscapes, all distinct types of clouds have to be understood first.
Natural clouds are typically identified by two major factors: shape and \gls{altitude}.

This graphic from \emph{sciencelearn} provides and excellent overview of all distinct cloud types.
Each type is depicted in its signature shape and marked with the scientific name and abbreviation.

\subsubsection{Classification of Altitude}
The \gls{altitude}, which is the distance from sea level to the cloud, is further split into three categories "low", "mid" and "high".
