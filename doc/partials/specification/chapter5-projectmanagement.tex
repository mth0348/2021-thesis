\section{Project management}

\subsection{Schedule}
The time frame of the semester spans over exactly 16 weeks. Being worth 12 ECTS points, this project assumes a maximum work load of 22.5 hours per week, resulting in a total of 360 hours.

\\
Over the course of the term, the project will be split into four primary task groups, namely organization, research, prototyping and finalization.
Put into relation with the duration of the project, the estimated schedule looks like this:

During research and prototyping, the documentation will be continuously updated.
\\
For each task group, the following distribution of time and effort is estimated:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Task group}  & \textbf{Predicted effort}\\ \hline
    Organization        & 10\%                      \\ \hline
    Research            & 35\%                      \\ \hline
    Implementation      & 50\%                      \\ \hline
    Finalizing          & 5\%                       \\ \hline
